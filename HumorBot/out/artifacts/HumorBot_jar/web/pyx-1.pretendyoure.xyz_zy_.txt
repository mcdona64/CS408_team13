<h3>A Cards Against Humanity clone.</h3>
<p>
This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay
very much. To assist with development, <strong>all traffic on this server <em>may</em> be
logged.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The name you enter and your computer's IP address will <strong>always</strong> be logged when you
load the game client. Chat and gameplay may also be logged.
</p>
<p>Recent Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 March 2018:<ul>
<li>Added reconnection to the card database server after it restarts. This really should have
been done years ago... This is what caused all of the errors while trying to start a game with
locally-stored decks.</li>
<li>The "view cards" page has been re-enabled.</li>
<li>Full games sort to the bottom of the game list.</li>
<li>Added more metrics logging. Sounds boring, but it's important for the long-term viability
of these servers.</li>
<li>All official CAH cards through Q3 2017 have been added, and deck names and contents have
been shuffled accordingly. Any cards not currently in any official decks are now removed.
The PAX panel sets have also been removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>13 August 2017:<ul>
<li><strong>Global chat is disabled.</strong> Far too spammy, far too shitty. Go shitpost
somewhere else, or at least take it to a game chat.</li>
<li>Added metrics logging. This will allow analysis over what cards are played often, and
regional trends. See the next bullet point for details. Your username and chat will
<strong>never</strong> be stored permanently.</li>
<li><a href="privacy.html"><strong>Hey, this is important:</strong> Read the privacy page for
details about what gameplay information is collected and how it's shared.</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="changelog.html">Older entries.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open the game more than once in the same browser.</strong> Neither instance
will receive all data from the server, and you will not be able to play. I have an idea on how to
fix this, but I haven't had time to do so.</li>
<li>This game was extensively tested in <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.
It should work in all recent versions of major browsers, but it may not look 100% as intended. If
you find a major issue, please
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4f2e252e212e3b2e0f3c202c262e23282e222a3d61212a3b703c3a2d252a2c3b721f16176a7d7f2d3a28">email me</a> with a screenshot and the
name and version of the browser you are using, and I'll try to fix it.
</li>
<li>You may not always see your card in the top area after you play it, but it has been played.
Also, sometimes the card will display in the top area but be small. I have no idea why either of
these happen.</li>
<li>If you refresh in the game, an error will pop up in the log briefly before the refresh
happens. It is safe to ignore.</li>
<li>You may see an error after joining a game. As the error message states, this is safe to
ignore. I will figure out a way to make this not show up.</li>
<li>Interface elements may not be perfectly sized and positioned immediately after loading the
page if your window is sufficiently small. Resize the window to fix.</li>
<li>A player joining the game in progress may have a slightly incorrect representation of the
game state until the next round begins.</li>
<li>Reloading the page when the winning card is displayed does not display the winning card
again.</li>
<li>Played cards seem to blank when someone joins or leaves. You may have to refresh the page
to see the cards again if you're the Card Czar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Black Cards with "pick" and/or "draw" annotations is rudimentary. When you play
your cards, it does not group them until the judging starts. Also, when other players play cards,
you do not see any progress from them until they have played all 2 or 3 cards, and it only shows
a single face-down card for them. I will try to make this look nicer, but it works.
<ul>
<li>Also, you cannot un-do your first (or second) card: Once it's played, it's played.</li>
<li>While judging, only one card will be highlighted. It does not matter which card in a group
you click, the game will figure it out.</li>
<li>I know that when you have a lot of players, especially with Pick 2 or Pick 3, it gets very
hard to read, and cards overlap (and underlap) your hand, and are hard to click sometimes.
I'll work on this soon. You can resize the window to try to help if you're having problems
for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can't bet Awesome Points to play another card, and I am unsure if I will add this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be an option to display who played every card.</li>
<li>A registration system and long-term statistics tracking may be added at some point.</li>
<li>Support for custom Black and White cards will also likely be added, with a game host option to
use them or just the stock cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the game seems to be in a weird state, refresh the page and it should take you back to where
you were. It would be helpful to take a screenshot and
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#07666d6669667366477468646e666b60666a627529696273387472656d6264733a575e5f223537657260">email it to me</a> along with a general
description of the problem and the time that it happened (include a time zone please!).
