<h3>A Cards Against Humanity clone.</h3>
<p>
This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay
very much. To assist with development, <strong>all traffic on this server <em>may</em> be
logged.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The name you enter and your computer's IP address will <strong>always</strong> be logged when you
load the game client. Chat and gameplay may also be logged.
</p>
<p>Recent Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>27 March 2018:<ul>
<li>You may now provide a password-like identification code when connecting to positively
identify yourself and make it difficult for someone to impersonate you. Details are on
<a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/wiki/Identification-Codes">the GitHub
wiki.</a><ul>
<li><strong>This is optional, and if you choose to not do so, everything will work the same as
it always has.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not use a password you use on any other site.</strong></li>
<li>The value you enter in the identification code box will be combined with your username
and a server secret and converted into an 11 character code.</li>
<li>Users that have an identification code will have a + in front of their name in chat.
Hover your mouse over their message to see their 11 character code.</li>
<li>You may also use the <span style="font-family:monospace">/whois</span> command in the chat
to view information about a user, including their 11 character code.</li></ul></li>
<li>Images on CardCast cards is now supported in a safe manner. Cards will need updated to work
with this format. Information on how to use it is on the
<a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/wiki/Cardcast#images-on-cards">GitHub
wiki.</a></li>
<li><strong>Automatic chat moderation has been added.</strong> This is fairly crude, and limits
the following behavior:<ul>
<li>(Global only, if enabled) Messages may not contain large amounts of non-Latin characters
(emoji spam, etc.).</li>
<li>(Global only, if enabled) CAPS LOCK IS NOT ALLOWED EITHER.</li>
<li>(Global only, if enabled) Once your message is a certain length, you have to actually use
multiple words.</li>
<li>Global and game chats now have different messages-per-unit-time settings and counters.
</li>
<li>You may not repeat the same message multiple times in a row.</li>
<li>Certain characters and words will cause a message to be silently dropped (that is, instead
of returning an error message to the person who typed it like all of the previous things will,
the server will just ignore the message altogether so that user does not know their message
was ignored). There are currently two things on this list, and no, I'm not telling you what
they are, and no, they're not actually in Git either.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>1 March 2018:<ul>
<li>Added reconnection to the card database server after it restarts. This really should have
been done years ago... This is what caused all of the errors while trying to start a game with
locally-stored decks.</li>
<li>The "view cards" page has been re-enabled.</li>
<li>Full games sort to the bottom of the game list.</li>
<li>Added more metrics logging. Sounds boring, but it's important for the long-term viability
of these servers.</li>
<li>All official CAH cards through Q3 2017 have been added, and deck names and contents have
been shuffled accordingly. Any cards not currently in any official decks are now removed.
The PAX panel sets have also been removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="changelog.html">Older entries.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open the game more than once in the same browser.</strong> Neither instance
will receive all data from the server, and you will not be able to play. I have an idea on how to
fix this, but I haven't had time to do so.</li>
<li>This game was extensively tested in <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.
It should work in all recent versions of major browsers, but it may not look 100% as intended. If
you find a major issue, please
<a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/issues/new">open a bug on GitHub</a> with a
screenshot and the name and version of the browser you are using, and I'll try to fix it.
</li>
<li>You may not always see your card in the top area after you play it, but it has been played.
Also, sometimes the card will display in the top area but be small. I have no idea why either of
these happen.</li>
<li>If you refresh in the game, an error will pop up in the log briefly before the refresh
happens. It is safe to ignore.</li>
<li>You may see an error after joining a game. As the error message states, this is safe to
ignore. I will figure out a way to make this not show up.</li>
<li>Interface elements may not be perfectly sized and positioned immediately after loading the
page if your window is sufficiently small. Resize the window to fix.</li>
<li>A player joining the game in progress may have a slightly incorrect representation of the
game state until the next round begins.</li>
<li>Reloading the page when the winning card is displayed does not display the winning card
again.</li>
<li>Played cards seem to blank when someone joins or leaves. You may have to refresh the page
to see the cards again if you're the Card Czar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Black Cards with "pick" and/or "draw" annotations is rudimentary. When you play
your cards, it does not group them until the judging starts. Also, when other players play cards,
you do not see any progress from them until they have played all 2 or 3 cards, and it only shows
a single face-down card for them. I will try to make this look nicer, but it works.
<ul>
<li>Also, you cannot un-do your first (or second) card: Once it's played, it's played.</li>
<li>While judging, only one card will be highlighted. It does not matter which card in a group
you click, the game will figure it out.</li>
<li>I know that when you have a lot of players, especially with Pick 2 or Pick 3, it gets very
hard to read, and cards overlap (and underlap) your hand, and are hard to click sometimes.
I'll work on this soon. You can resize the window to try to help if you're having problems
for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can't bet Awesome Points to play another card, and I am unsure if I will add this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be an option to display who played every card.</li>
<li>A registration system and long-term statistics tracking may be added at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the game seems to be in a weird state, refresh the page and it should take you back to where
you were. It would be helpful to take a screenshot and include it in a
<a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/issues/new">new bug on GitHub</a> along with
a general description of the problem and the time that it happened (include a time zone please!).
