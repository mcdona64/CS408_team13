This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay
very much. To assist with development, <strong>all traffic on this server <em>may</em> be
logged.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The name you enter and your computer's IP address will <strong>always</strong> be logged when you
load the game client. Chat will almost certainly never be logged at all, and if it is, it is only
temporary. Gameplay <strong>is</strong> always logged for determining popular cards.
